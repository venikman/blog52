# System thinking course
They did not lie when they said it would be more intense than the previous course. It takes a lot of time to read slowly (because you have to understand it, and without total concentration, I will not be able to do it).

# Homeoffice
I realized I needed a big (massive) office table and book shelf. But it was all costly, so I bought it partially and assembled it myself. This is what I have got as a plan:
For table:

# Article writer for Wikipedia
LOL, nope. I am not an article writer for Wiki; however, I am helping a group of people from SSM update an article about system thinking in Russian and then update it to an English version. I will share it later. But there were already many things I had never known about how Wikipedia works. 

# Technology radar from ThoughtWorks
[Technology Radar | An opinionated guide to today's technology landscape | Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-au/radar)

ThoughtWorks is a respected company, and it has in its squad [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/). A few times a year, the company publishes an opinionated "radar" of 4 categories: Techniques, Tools, Platforms, and "Languages & Frameworks." Where each category is sliced into four more sections already based on their recommendation:
- **Adopt**. Blips are something that you should seriously consider using.
— **Trial**. We think these things are ready for use but are only partially proven, such as those in the Adopt ring. 
- **Assess**. These are Things to look at closely, but not necessarily trial yet, unless you think they would be a particularly good fit for you.
- **Hold**. Proceed with caution.

Highly recommended!
