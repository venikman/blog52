# Overview

This week was very busy and unorganized. It felt super busy, but I wonder if I got done much. So,
this summary will be more like breadcrumbs.

## Small events create bigger changes.

At [THAT conference]([[ZET/Sumaries/W5-2024#THAT|W5-2024]]), I received a nice small light for my
phone in case I need more light. And this tool got my brain to think about how I can use it since
it's cool and I already have. And then I have a memory about my Samsung phone coming to me as the
system I can use to leverage the functionality of light. And this is what I am trying to do.

## Debugging and Techdept

This week, I received a huge reminder about what techdept can look like in a year if you do not care
about it in the first place. I am _trying_ not to complain. The main point that I want to make is
for all engineers to have more empathy for the old code, and when you write new code yourself, try
to take care of the future. #FutureReady

## A new addition to the daily routine

This week I have found a very short daily #checklist that you can fill out what is on your mind:

- **Thoughts**: Whatâ€™s on my mind now?
  - Is my train of thought helpful? What can be done to change it?
- **Energy**: How am I feeling?
  - How is my energy level? Can I maintain or improve it?
- **Attention**: What matters to me?
  - What should I focus on? What should I accomplish?

I found it in some blog posts referring to
[Google's doc](https://blog.google/documents/103/T.E.A_Check-in_Guide_-_External_.pdf/).

## Kubernetes

Since my new work focus is getting even more into `docker` and `Kubernetes`, it is a great time for
a book from manning.com to finally ship to me `MEAN` type of the book that I ordered Black Friday
2022 for `k8s` [Kubernetes for Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-for-developers).

## Learning `sed`

Should you learn sed in 2024? This week, I went back and was forced to strongly believe that this
skill is very useful (especially if you spend a lot of time in a shell ). Even before it, I put my
eyes on awk, but when I realized the use cases for sed and awk, it became obvious what could be more
useful for me. However, when I was getting on the camp of opinion that sed is not something, you
have to learn because you can get the same thing in more modern languages like JS (fueled by bun and
deno). Specifically, what I was referring to is
[dax-sh - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dax-sh).

## Github Certification

Github finally started offering certification. Since MSFT now owns them, my first exam will be
Foundational on #02-18-2024. It will be 120 minutes long.
