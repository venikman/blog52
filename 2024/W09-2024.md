# Angel investor of relationships
Why are we okay with our investment strategy for finance, where we usually spend time planning and trying to have a long vision for it? So in the future, we can enjoy our deserved time. But all know that money is just a tool and not going to enjoy it by having money itself. We will want to spend them on good service and gifts to our family while traveling. Also, we (me definitely) will want to share this time with my friends. But nobody promising that we will have good friends then. Usually, it is like money: the earlier you start building friendships, the stronger the bonds of the company you will get when you are ready to spend your invested money. What about your family? Your kids? Your spouse? I am not discussing deserving your family or your friend's attention and making them owe you. I am talking about making your bonds more robust and more enjoyable! 

This is what I have got from book review from Productivity Game: [How Will You Measure Your Life? by Clayton Christensen | Core Message - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCX6vAvglAI) 

The book's author offers another view of 3 kinds of relationships we have in our lives (building relationships with friends, raising kids, and spouse or partner relationships). What if you look at them as building a business? Invest in it with the idea that you will get a return. Again, you will not return from other people but from the bonds and connections you develop. 
## Friendship
- Compliment. Do extra (but be honest) on complimenting your friend. Similar what Kent Beck shared this week: [Productive Compliments: Giving, Receiving, Connecting](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/productive-compliments-giving-receiving?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=256838&post_id=142134414&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=yo8ni&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email). Takes time to practice being good but only returning you benefits.
- Congratulateâ€”another extra mile, which is similar to a Compliment. The main difference is that sometimes we think congratulations should be something unique and meaningful, but this is our opinion on what is small or big. Do not evaluate or congratulate (again, you must be happy for your friend) any events happening with them.
- Console. Be present in their life. And not only in good times, real friends do not call in hard times, real friends coming onsite!

## Rising kids
The more you invest in your kids initially, the bigger the return. In return, I mean a robust and trusted relationship. Clayton recommends maximizing verbal communication in the first 30 months of their life. And after embodying family values. (In my family, I am investing in having a Christmas tradition of going to the diner on Christmas.)

# Personal finance section
This time of the year is around taxes, so my attention has been dragged to finance. My mind found two topics that I have spent time on. 
## Food delivery
Last month, my wife and I decided to try to use some food delivery services. We used to use some at the beginning of the COVID but stopped because it was not better financially, and Sasha (my wife) does like to cook herself. This time, our interest was triggered by necessity: while adapting to living with kids without our grandparents' help, we had to introduce shortcuts. Food prep was one of them. We have been using Hello Fresh for a few weeks since this is what we have used in the past, and it was alright. But I wanted to check if there are other options (probably new players on the market since COVID-19 started). I have found a few:
- [Site Unreachable](https://www.blueapron.com/on-the-menu)
- [The Affordable Meal Delivery Service | Dinnerly](https://dinnerly.com/)

We did not try this, but I want to try each. To see if there is financial benefit, quality, or convenience.

## Moneyunder30
While researching the best food delivery options, great articles with recommendations were at [Money Under 30](https://www.moneyunder30.com/). And I liked a few things: no ads, no desire to sell you anything, and helpful information. Usually, it does mean that you are the product. Well, if this is true, I am fine. As extended information, they will be giving me benefits. Information is relevant to many groups only if you have so much money that you can spend all of it. LOL.

# Local conf - Frontrunners.
After THAT conference, I have been [[[[ZET/Sumaries/W5-2024#THAT|talking]] about how ideas about local communities stuck with me. I have started actively looking at how I can get involved or at least visit local events. One of the events I have found is [Frontrunners](https://frontrunners.tech/) conf, which is one entire day-long event in DC. I already got my ticket and look forward to spending the day with local software engineers. I will share what I have learned that is interesting next week.

# Higher Education in the US
Got recommended to watch conversation from Ben and Marc at a16z: [Crisis in Higher Ed & Why Universities Still Matter - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J2_G4oHRQ0)

This conversation was motivated by Ben and Mark being worried about the current situation of higher education in the US because they know and believe that many benefits and goods for society have happened and will happen. But they wanted to highlight some spots that should be improved. 
In two two-hour conversation, they covered the following: 
Recommended book: "The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money" by Bryan Caplan

Interesting fact: Some schools, like Harvard, are older than the US. Where they have started as religious institutions.

## Credentialing
The more popular the school, the more chances you have of getting a job by having a diploma from this place. Companies have this trust for universities because it is hard to get in, and it takes an effort to graduate from it. And since the SAT is getting into the back seat and grades are getting into the shadows, what would be the criteria for employers to evaluate you? There is a prediction here that companies will start doing additional testing to have this checked.

Also a lot popularity in the world US schools have and there are extension schools that have name of the popular places, but without popular professors teaching the students, bringing with not financial help students just because of the name.  It does not make a good reputation for the schools.

## Education courses
There are 4 types of academic programs:
- Humanities (Literature, languages, History, Philosophy, Religion...)
- STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
- Social science (Economics, Psychology, Sociology, Political science...)
- Trade Schools. (Law school, Medical school, Business school, and some art schools...)

Problem with programs: in the school, every program has the exact cost, but your salary will depend on that field of your education. And only some areas can give you enough financial compensation to repay a total student loan. In addition even with filling Bankruptcy you can not get rid off student loan.

Plus, it has been growing since the government started to help with payments for education. Numbers are:
Since 1980, overall inflation(US CPI)) is +228% and for College Tuition inflation +1184%.

## University as a Research bureau
Researches is happening in universities, and for staff to grow in careers they have to publish papers to game the system, last year there were 3millions of research papers. And we have replication crisis, from 20% to 70% papers can not be replicated. And if you can not replicate your research - it is not a science. 
## Policy think tank.
Hundred years ago media used to be a place where you can read findings from scientists, and it was very good channel for consumption for politic people, read some new scientific discovery in the morning and then go and use this knowledge to make our society better. Now, it is different.

## What can be done?
Three areas that they see solutions can be found:
- Fix current institutions
- Open more universities

# Node test module
Knowledge from: [How I combined node:test with TypeScript! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vICQMCS9AIY)
Nodejs has native module `node:test` as you can guess for testing since `node@18.19.1`. I did not use it yet, but I knew. And was waiting for someone share practical adoption or great fit for my current work project to use it. Well first happen earlier. Matteo Collina adopted testing module with `typescript` and share his module (wrapper for `ts`and `node:test`).  But for myself, for now, I took only knowledge about testing modules:
- 3 main library to use: `node:test, node:assert, node:timers/promises`. 
- You can control how tests should be executed, in parallel(to be faster) or in order, if desired by tests.
- You can make test cases asynchronous with `async` before `test().`

# Keyboard Ergonomics
Following my interest raised [[Publish/2024/W08-2024#Ergonomic mouse and keyboard|last week]] for trying to add some enchantments for my keyboard. I did order [blank keycaps ](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/kc360-bk/)for my Kinesis advantage360. And set for lubing key switches. Key switches on advantage360 are not how-swappable, but you can still lube them; this is my plan. I have never done it before, so I will be careful not to break my $400 keyboard. I have been inspired by [How to lube non-hot-swappable switches - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2nUd68rneo). On video it makes it look simple and had recommendations for which set to buy to make it happen.

# Another one
Thinking experiment: You love idea of types in JavaScript but what TypeScript providing for you developer experience is not enough, and you have been task to come up with the solution? I do not have an answer to the way to go (which I will choose to go with) but I do know what idea build another super set layer for JS over TS will make me feel really bad. 

Well, it is just an experiment. But somebody decided to do it and do it. I do love motivation behind but I want to be very surprised to see it wide adoption. It could push TS and JS languages but to make it significant group of developers should start choosing it to improve their lives, but who will be those people?
