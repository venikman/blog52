1. In-process syntax-based analysis of individual source files based
   on [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). Here is previous blog post where
   author goes more deeper on it: [Treesetter in zed](https://zed.dev/blog/syntax-aware-editing)
2. External servers that provide semantic understanding via

# DDiMDDW - Deep Dive into Model-Driven Design Workshop.

I have made my choice of
[workshop](https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/training/deep-dive-into-model-driven-design-workshop/?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=kenny_baas_bruno_boucard&mc_cid=adb58f6254)

This is what I want to use as part of my educational budget.

# Update on wishlist

This is so epic of what ergonomic split keyboards can
[offer](https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/training/deep-dive-into-model-driven-design-workshop/?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=kenny_baas_bruno_boucard&mc_cid=adb58f6254).

# Another video of the book review has been watched.

So glad I can watch it and decide if I should read it. This time, the answer was NO. But it does not
mean the book is not useful. For me, information from the book is really valuable; I just felt that
I knew all of it; but, I did not use it. So it was a great reminder for me, here is what I have
refreshed:

## Book: Manage your day to day

### Great daily reminder/checklist:

- How might I...
- What else could I do...
- What If I...

I have added this to my daily template.

### You have four choices:

- Do little every day OR bunch at once.
- Reactive OR creative. Check your email later. Use morning time for creative work.
- Rigid OR Flexible
- Systain OR Cicle.

# Streams in programming

I always feared working with streams because I did not understand them. I still don't. I should
teach streams to someone who is forced to realize it. I have watched this week
[small workshop from Matteo Callina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edB964-YYpE). It was helpful
for me to trigger my interest in it again (instead of feeling fear). I will start thinking about how
I can go over this idea. Here are some facts that trigger me by being understandable:

- streams exist to handle data that is more (in size) than.
- Do not use streams if you already have all the data in memory.

# Shameless plugs from Syntax FM

I have not watched [SyntaxFM](https://syntax.fm) for over four years, but they always have nice
shameless plugs at the show's end. They even created a whole
[section](https://syntax.fm/sickpicks)about it; they called it "sick picks." I want to share here
some VSCode extensions that I have found very interesting:
