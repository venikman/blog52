# Don't give up!

Hello there, I missed a week of note-summary, which differs from what I planned at the beginning of
the year! I am getting close to the middle of the year, and I don't see a reason why I should stop.
Last weekend was my son's birthday; he turned one year old! And on the same day, I got food
poisoning... I missed the restaurant visit and the whole weekend. I could wake up only Monday
morning and bring to a computer for work. I have accepted that one week has been missed. Life goes
on.

# Methods

Working on a new project and going through my Systems Thinking and Methodology class makes me feel I
have become twice as competent in the last two months. One of the main concepts that caught my
attention was the method. I will be talking about it much more!

## ADR

https://adr.github.io/ - Light instrument is described as a method of deciding on any technical/team
norm choice for the team.

There is no need to make lovely diagrams; it is even better to do it as a table/model or just text.
But still, when you see some handy models and nicely diagrammed, you are inspired to do the same.
And this is what I want to try to do when will be modeling for the public: https://roadmap.sh/

# Modeling

- [ ] One of the models I want to make - is Access Management. ➕ 2024-05-20
- [ ] Model for my note-taking method ➕ 2024-05-20

When you model, there are types of relationships:

- Classification
- Specialization
- Composition
- Realization(implementation)
- Creation

# Book review: Slow Productivity

## Do fewer things

Create busy buffer

- Office hour one before and one after.
- Reverse task list: public to-do list.

## Obsess over quality

Release pressure

- Quality.

## Work at a natural pace.

- Walking... Slowing down. Why is this cool?

# Technical leadership

What is it for me to be a "Technical leader":

- Crafter aiming for excellence at the border of SoTA and beyond.
- Evangelist of the technical culture in the company.
- Consulting business leaders on technical options/choices by zooming out from projects/products in
  the strategic thinking.
- Explore the company's IT and see the best time use.

# What can we do as a service

Reduce risk and help to see meaningful progress at every step.
