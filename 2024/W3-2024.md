## Meme generation

This week was my final week of the semester. We had an exam. But we had an escape way: prepare memes
about ontological chatter that related to our profession. One meme required, but I did like to do it
and created 5. I have used the [Meme generator platform](https://iloveimg.com), which has popular
mems templates and an editor for text. Here are my memes:

They are in Russian, so who understands? I hope you had fun.

## Done.

The exam went well, and I got my qualification. GG. My next plan is shared in
[blog](https://secondfile.substack.com/p/change-of-habits).

# Huberman Podcast

## Music

Listen to podcasts on the topic of music. Few points about music that I did not consider before:

- Music can describe emotions better than language.
- We get excited or motivated because our brains always try to predict the next song/sound. And if
  we hear what our brain did not predict but like that sound, we get a lot of dopamine.
- To motivate yourself, listen to music for 10-15 mins.
- Based on research, it is better to listen to music without lyrics or complete silence to get into
  focus.

# Being a blogger

I want to get more public (get more followers) at _X_, exploring how _Communities_ work at _X_ and
what it will look like to write long posts on _X_. As part of testing, I have joined 2 communities:
_FP_ and _Haskell_. And I have created my own. It is limited or only available if you are a paid
user.

# DDD with Scott Wlachin

My prep for the February workshop with Scott is coming, so it is time to start reading his book
Domain Modeling Made Functional. Interestingly, a lot of terminology and practices (like event
storming) are what I just learned about ontology. For now, I am trying to collect terms (objects of
attention) of DDD and see what I already have different opinions on based on System Thinking; for
example, the book still used the concept _requirements_ whereas in ST, it is already an old thing.

## Some insights

- Listen (learn how to listen) domain expert.
- For B2B, you need more predictability than speed.
- In DDD, you have to fight the impulse to start designing the DB schema

# Ali book (youtuber)

Weekly book review from my YouTube subscription. This time, it was about very famous productivity
YouTuber Ali. I have watched Ali's few videos and was impressed by his results but not what he is
translating, mostly because I already knew all of it (heh, I wish I could do it all, not just
understand). But here are a few points that resonated with me from the book:

> Feel good as you work. What would this look like if it were fun?

- curiousity. Side quest: search for daily side quests to have more fun and feel accomplished.
- connection. Focusmate, virtual working space.
- confidence. Study with my strategy, such as listening to someone doing the stuff. I could do it
  myself. As streaming?

# HTMX

Disappointment of the week. Recently, it got a lot of noise and attention as a potential new player
for the front end, and last weekend, the creator of HTMX was talking about some
business(commercialization), so I spent some time thinking about it and speaking to Eric at work.
The last bit was me watching _ThePrimeagen_ stream having the creator of HTMX; it was too much. My
feelings were supported by _X_ opinion (community). Nothing wrong or bad in HTMX, but my curiosity
went away.

# World Economic Forum 2024

Did not watch it before. But this time, since AI is everywhere, I observed a few sessions:

- Siemens got some attention. They start to talk about their tech company... I am not excited about
  it, but looking at them as some hardware company for healthcare is something to keep an eye on.
- Satia Nadella (MSFT CEO) shared his view on AI and the economy. He said the economy is stagnating,
  and the tech side is negative. For AI - he has worked in MSFT for almost as long as I have been
  alive; he started operating in 1993. And when the Web for emerging, he heard that it was compared
  to _information at fingertip_. Now he is saying that with AI, we will have _Expertise at
  fingertips_. And what is the most exciting about it, and what we should be, is science and
  potential new discoveries. He also shared his 3 technologies that will be the big:
  - Quantum revolution (commute)
  - AI (of course)
  - Mixed reality

# TidyFirst

From email this week, I have an interesting idea based on how we measure Developer Productivity -
_effort→output→outcome→impact_. The thing that we can use is for everything we do. Even for
learning.

# Obsidian

I am really starting to think about Obsidian as my knowledge base... I have checked it recently and
realized that it is a little too complicated to configure if I really want it, and all that is
needed is _core plugins_. It will not be that hard to migrate; I still require more to make it
quickly manually. However, the benefits I get are better support for file systems, linking
knowledge, and more channels for AI support. My Grammarly works much better there, which is a huge
plus!

Should I use Obsidian for the following week's note-taking? Hmm, I will be traveling next weekend,
and to do so, I will have to get paid version _Sync_. But I know for sure that for $5 (Inkdrop), I
have only 1 more feature(publish) compared to $8 (Obsidian). As for publishing, I have already
considered making my personal page with a wish list and publishing notes. And I am getting better
UI + more plugins...

Ok, doing an experiment... The following week's notes will be based on notes from Obsidian, and I
may migrate public notes, too.

# AoEV

Had our call on Saturday. Here are a few new ideas for posts:

- Use tags for the reader to understand some raw text if I have the tag _WIP_ (work in progress).
- Another way is to be more specific about what is expected from the audience at the beginning of
  the text.

# CS50 2024

Public course for intro to programming evolving. This year, I checked their recordings, and they are
imposing! And now this already has a separate program for the cybersecurity program, everyone -
_RECOMMENDED_.

# Whitepaper as learning

This week found a research paper for learning as SE, and it ended up with me writing a series based
on this research. Also, I have subscribed to ACM magazine. Who knew it has been around since 1958!!!
Here is the initial

> Torvalds thinks AI will be great at code review for other developers. | I do agree.

PS. Next weekend going to Texas with family. Going _THAT_ conference. This is the first trial for my
52 goals weekly note summary. I will have to write a summary of a trip.
