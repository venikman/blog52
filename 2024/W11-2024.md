# Taking responsibility
Being an adult, a father of a 10-month-old kid, and growing personally is tough. It is also challenging to establish a routine that won't break at the first unexpected event (like it never happens in our lives and is always such a surprise). My single goal this year, 52 weekly summary notes, was at risk because of everything I listed at the beginning of the section. But I am glad I managed it without breaking the chain of my weekly routine. I was able to decrease volume but did not stop any process. I am proud of myself.

# The Energy Paradox (Book review)
You don't have to follow any diet to have natural energy initially. In addition to the 16-hour gap in fasting, if you eat in the morning, you can help your stomach by eating only one type of food (protein, carbs, or fat). 

## Thinking
That makes sense because you have to start three threads of workers for three types of food, and attention(plus energy) will be shared. But If I do fasting, I will not eat anyway, or when the first meal should start, and can I follow this rule? If I eat at 8 pm, the 16-hour gap will be at noon. But it will already be time for lunch, and making it a single type is challenging. Only if I do, and the second meal of the day will be dinner (and this is where I can have a great meal).

# Networking
I did not want to go there, but I feel like I need to go to lover levels to be able to understand systems and change them. 
## ARP 
Address Resolution Protocol. DNS is where you know the domain address and want to know which IP it belongs to. IPs are not static; they are changing and can change based on some logic. But you need an actual physical address as every building has. This is where ARP comes in —it is used to translate the current IP address to MAC. 

IP address playing at Layer 3. And MAC at Layer 2.

# Education
Following my [[Publish/2024/W09-2024#Higher Education in the US|overview of Fixing Higher Education]], I watched part of the second podcast. It was interesting as well. My main takeaway is that people have yet to find a way to tutor students better than 1x1.

# Unit testing presentation
What is the minimum prep I can do to present it to engineers from my team? I think I know the answer:
- 4 slides with every aspect of the unit test
- Slides with terminology (observable behavior, internal implementation...)
- Compare how it was done before
- And what can be changed? 
When I put it like this, it looks like a little. Can I do it by Wednesday? I can do it in an hour, so yes. I will share how did it go next week.

# Cognitive writing
I must start working with my old notes; work and thinking happen here. Try to re-review some old thoughts on the subject or my opinion. I have never done it; where could I start? For now, I should separate just rewriting and thinking on some topics not based on what I have seen or watched, but it can be the idea that I have got in my head while watching something but not what I was consuming. This is where I have to slow down on processing new information and minimize it. Better quality than quantity; you can only do it if you already have quantity. Could I start with quality? I don't think so—everything is just in time.

# Are you making money for the business? 
This is such a great thought: Can everybody realize how we make money for the business? If I am asked this question, I cannot answer it. Many people will be in the same situation as me; I want an answer, at least for myself!
