## Book Summary: The Only Skill That Matters
### Learning strategies
#### Multi-learning.
Emerging skills by learning two slightly related skills. General skill + sub-skill.
### Brute force learning
I can apply this for:
- Communication
- Rationality

When brute forcing, a good practice is to combine knowledge. Also, repetition of expertise (at SSM) is happening.
#### Push yourself up the learning pyramid.
Apply deep knowledge. To own skill, not just knowledge. Use it. Analyze the knowledge you apply.

## Joseph Schumpeter
More and more, we hear about this person and his view on what it means to be an entrepreneur and how using it will increase our chances of success.

Based on my research, his most famous book is: "Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy," where I am specifically interested in learning his definition of Entrepreneur; there is another book "Essays: On Entrepreneurs, Innovations, Business Cycles and the Evolution of Capitalism." So I will get both.
