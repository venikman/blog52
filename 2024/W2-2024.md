# Updates to my notetaking

In the spirit of constant improvement, I have changed my routine of making a summary based on daily
notes. I do not integrate information from daily notes into some long-run projects. Like every
temporary note, they have been archived at the end of the week. So this week, I am adding a new
object of my attention while working on weekly notes - information related to my _Areas_ or
_Projects_ will be sorted and migrated to the right place.

# Simon Sinek, The Art of Presenting.

## Be a _Giver_

One of my New Year's presents to myself was getting a video course from Simon Sinek, "The Art of
Presenting," and the main shift in my mindset that happened to me was the realization of the meaning
of presentations: "Presentation is not for presenters, it is for an audience." Suppose you have this
mindset when presenting anything; when you care more about the people who watch, you can miss
something, and the audience will not benefit from the information you offer. In that case, this is
where helping others makes you even more confident and with empathy, you become a great presenter.
Become _a giver_.

## Learnings

I have been researching presenting for a while, and I knew most of the information there. However,
some points that were new for me have been worth spending money and time on.

- Define _Why_ of the presentation.
- Having and sharing _Why_ in the beginning becoming great case for _Waterfall_ methodology!
- Presentation slides only help you set the scene for your actions.
- Prepare a second deck of slides with more material so you can share it afterward with people who
  are listening to you.
- Another place that reminds me to be more _slower_.
- I don't have to know more than the audience.

# SSM, Webinar, be ready for the unpredicted future that is already here.

[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcpsnL1esw)

Watched an online webinar from one of the main ideologists of the school, Anatolii Levenchuk, where
he talked about how the future is usually changing the way our world works and is still relevant
from a professional standpoint to what we can be doing today. The Main variable is that AI is
coming, and we will have to prepare ourselves. To do so, it is better to explore and learn
meta-disciplines that usually take longer to change, and they will be the latest when AI can take
over. So, the best bet is to educate yourself in engineering.

# Advisory board, 11 Things CEOs Need to Know in 2024

[Link for logged-in users](https://www.advisory.com/topics/strategy-planning-and-growth/2024/01/11-things-ceos-need-to-know)
I got to read this _prediction_ of the future based on the past; it was fascinating to see where we
are currently and how everybody (or many people influenced by this document) will be thinking.

## Where we deliver care.

Ecosystems of care:

1. Patient health and access are far worse as healthcare emerges from the pandemic.
2. Health systems seek long-term durability.
3. Ecosystem players will configure their assets to guide patient behavior within a market.
4. Medicare Advantage attracts continued investment despite a tightening business model.

## Who(and what) delivers care.

Technology-dependent care teams. 5. The clinical workforce shortage is a chronic condition for the
industry. 6. Purpose technology investments can alleviate workforce pressure. 7. Artificial
intelligence is a strategy enabler, not a strategy in itself.

## How we pay for care.

Bespoke care. 8. High-cost drugs will increase the complexity of care delivery, not just its cost.
9. The growing collection and use of real-world patient data will make proactive, personalized
patient care possible. 10. Revolutionary treatments undermine traditional drug cost management
tools. 11. Employer coverage decision today will set the pace for the industry's overall adoption of
bespoke care.

# APIs in Humana

A rare episode of Humana's IT representation speaks publicly. I have found and watched this
[video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w78Q_Vgw_yw). Real-life problems of large healthcare
enterprises have been covered.

# SSM course, finale

Final week starting from Thursday on a course. This week, wanna cover two points:

## Lesson 19. Meta-model of communication

We did not practice communication. But we talked about the meta-model; this is a theory behind it
(modeling by pointing to the proper objects of attention we must consider when communicating). The
leading practice was on being able to identify the "goal" of communication, which is based on the
role of the agent that participates in it; the thing is, it could be more than one based on time
scale interests (roles).

Also, we discussed "prepare for presentation" or "monologue" as a very slow form of communication
because you have a lot of time to think about sending information to the other side. However,
achieving the goal is much more complicated because you need quick feedback.

## First half of exam

Since we had 2 disciplines covered in the course, we had to cover 2 topics/parts of the exam. The
first half was about _composure_. We have to summarize all homework on this topic and retrospective
results:

- what I was able to add to my life/routine.
- what did not.
- my future plans on it.

I have written it in my [blog](https://secondfile.substack.com/p/change-of-habits).

# Scott Wlaschin and his intro to FP with zombies

Scott getting more and more credits from me for his ability to explain complex topics. Here is one
more example of him using Francenstain to introduce people to FP and main concepts of it:

# Networking (social discipline, not web)

Great reminder for myself and everybody:

> Build and keep your network in good shape.

# DNS (domain name space)

The last 2 years of my work showed me that I am terrible at networking; terrible means I really
don't know what it is, making my job harder, and I have more stress. So my brain was constantly
looking for excellent materials (I am also in very long chronic research for streaming data on the
web, not like Netflix) for networking (DNS included). I have found an excellent course for it. I
also have great zines, but they will be covered when I read them.

I am not going to cover what I did not memorize. Still, I will share some realizations and learnings
that I was able to integrate into my knowledge (view of how the web works):

- 2 types of first-level domains:
  - ccTLD (country content). Each country can have it(so we have around 250). And you can always see
    them, they are 2 char long.
  - gTLD (generic). 3+ chars long. Types:
    - generic
    - generic restricted
    - brand
    - sponsored
    - infrastructure
    - test
- 3 roles: registry, registar, and register.
- ICAN organization. Responsible for `root` zone, admin for TLD database.
- `whois` is an old protocol, and now everybody uses `rdap` [read about rdap](https://rdap.net)
- IDN (international domain names). Protocol to support 1 domain level for Unicode. Like:
  `www.стас.com`. You must use _punycode_ translator into old unicode, which will always start with
  `xn--`. [portal](https://punycoder.com)
- ![Screenshot 2024-01-13 at 1.40.42 PM](HeRV0sRgd-Screenshot_2024-01-13_at_1.40.42 PM.png)
- Glue records are a thing. It is helpful for Google. `dig google.com NS` `dig .com NS.` The main
  problem and beauty of DNS is caching.
- Duck DNS org.
- [Set of excellent tricks for DNS](https://dns.toys)
- Record types (not all):
  ![Screenshot 2024-01-14 at 5.01.15 PM](vuXDm9T-g-Screenshot_2024-01-14_at_5.01.15 PM.png)
- `A` record has `ipv4` and `AAAA` or (Quad A) has `ipv6`.
- `CNAME` is a Canonical name that maps one domain to another. A great use case is to map `www.` to
  the domain without it. But think of it as something other than redirect.
- `TXT` record type. The legacy feature created for admins now has a real-life use case.
- `PTR` record type. Reverse lookup from `ip` to domain name.

# Scott Wlaschin, Domain Modeling Made Functional

This year's primary goal is to get 52 weekly notes done. I still have a secondary plan: This goal is
to explore modeling, and one of the flavors is in the `DDD` theme. The first step towards it is to
read [Scott's book](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/) as prep for
his workshop (I will talk about it in my later notes). I just started but already have some great
insights I am looking forward to using at my work:

> Developer is responsible for solving problems through software. Coding is just one of the
> practices it can use. Communication and sound design are also practices that developers have to
> use.

> Garbage in, garbage out.

## What DDD is useful for

For business and enterprise software, developers must collaborate with other nontechnical teams.

## Not good for

Flexible data structure

## Used to have with waterfall:

Domain expert -> Business analytic -> [Requirements doc] -> Architect -> [Design doc] -> Development
team -> [Code]

## Agile:

Domain expert -> Development team -> [Code] -> Domain expert

## DDD way:

Domain expert -> [Shared model] <- Dev team other stakeholder -> [Shared model] <- [Code]

# SSM AoEV

Our group had a concise meeting, but I still was able to get a few good notes:

- Separation of 2 roles: Blogger - where the main goal is to share information and get attention
  (even if it is not always the information you sharing). And thinker with text.
- Explore _communities_ of _X_.
