## DevOps

Before I started to write daily notes and share summarization of them weekly, I began watching DevOps workshop recordings. It will be helpful for my interest in getting deeper knowledge about DevOps in the company and how the industry is looking at it. I have been sharing some insights as I go (and my speed on this is really slow). This week, I learned that the service *Droppler*, was described as a token and secret sharing for Local Development between teammates. I got really interested because the term "Local Development" is something I feel is essential to include in a set of important objects when a team is coming up with a strategy for DevOps. So I looked at it a bit and learned that the service primarily solves billing and partial access to some services. I will have to watch more about using this service at the workshop, but from the first look, how this service can solve problems for local development needs to be clarified.

Also, I am getting more and more signals that TerraForm(TF) is always the primary *hub* for DevOps engineers, and this is something I want to learn more about, or instead of TF itself, spend more time digging into the concept of infrastructure as a code. My first opinion about using Git (Github) as a source of infrastructure and not using DB changing. It is actually starting to feel more natural using Git as a state holder. But I want to put more time into reasoning and see more versions of it in the real world.

## Started to look for Chatterings 

It is my homework to look for ontological chattering. Still, I can benefit more if I make it my habit to identify them and collect them. Can I make it? I will try to search for them and note it.

This week, I was able to catch 4 (3 at work and 1 with family). However, I want to be careful about not highlighting them immediately; the main goal for now is to practice more in identifying them and using them as signals to change my communication strategy.

## NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)

Started to watch some lessons on NLP. I am trying to remember how I found the online course and why I even started watching it. Still, I have found a lot of similar ideas and terms from ontology. This insight only added more interest to it. I will share some interesting bits of information that I have found valuable and essential to remember.

There are 3 types of modality each person uses for communication, and usually, 1 of them is primary to personality:

- Visual: this is where a person, when talking, always tries to describe a picture, talks very quickly, and hands that person over their chest. Plus, the voice is high. Examples of people like this are commentators and dictators.
- Audio, monotonous, one temp, hand at the level of chest or lover. Example: Lectors.
- Tactile, slow speech, voice very low, hands below chest.

> Intuition - unconscious experience. *Very true*

### Lie and how to identify it

When words are not compliant with body language.

We have 2 types of channels: 
- Mono, we have only a single source of that channel. 
- Stereo, we have 2 parts of the body to channel information. Like the eyes and sides of a mouse. Hangs.

1, 2, 3, 5 - images. This is where a person will look when talking in visual modality.
4, 6, 9 - audio.
7, 8 - fillings.

### Milton and meta models

* Milton model - is where a person is talking/describing a task or world, and there are options for the receiver to interpret/add personal flavor/understanding. Usually used for manipulation.
* Meta model - is where interpretation is particular, and there is no room for different interpretations.

Usually, when some laws are being written, the ideal version should be - What that law is about (covered by metamodel so everybody understands exactly what is being controlled). Milton is used when part of the talked-about groups that are being covered by this law. So there is room for a bigger audience to make them think that they are included, too.

#### 7 versions of the Milton model
1. Namilization.
2. Subjects have not been identified.
3. No specific verb is being used.
4. Missing context.
5. Generalization.
6. Opinionated comparison.
7. Modal operators being used.

## Kristen's year summary and reflection on its workshop. 



I have participated in 5 hours online workshop from Kristen Hadeed on year reflection and planning/putting some goals into the upcoming year. No regrets, *9/10*. Why not 10? People from the workshop could be more engaged. Nothing wrong with them! There could be some selection/filtering or some method to increase the importance of the workshop and make breakout room practice even greater!

I was able to remind myself of my **WHY**, which is: *To alchemize curiosity so everyone can enjoy the process.* 

I have to put it everywhere as a reminder for myself so other people know what I am **WHY**.

### Remedy and Revive

I have selected words to set the context for the whole workshop. I want to keep them in my attention for a while and see why I have chosen those 2 words. 

### Sharing gratitude
This exercise was one of the best parts of the workshop. Everyone was tasked to write gratitude messages to people you are grateful for! I did share with a few, and it was very powerful, almost as powerful as when I had to apologize.

### Start and Stop doing 
Also, a great insight was when we had to think about what I had to start and stop doing.
*Stop*:
- Meeting in the morning at work: Since I am very productive in the mornings, I should consider holding more meetings ( even team meetings) after lunch to finish work in the morning.

*Start*:
- Start going to the office. This idea has been around my brain for a while. I agree with many reasons, so I should really consider and make it happen.
- Focus on output. I am not focusing on input but on incoming material: "This will be useful." So, I even spend more time filtering upcoming information than processing it. I would better spend time making results with the information I already have. And make use of it. 

### GOAL for the whole year

**52 weekly summaries.** - This is what I am investing in. After almost finishing the SSM course that has already been going for 4 months, I will go for one more month. Proved that I can focus on 4 (even 5) months' goals. This year, I want to focus for a year! It aligns with every desire I have right now: "focus on output," "notetaking," and "publicity." 

### Future postcard
I have written messages for myself in the future. And put it to send it to me on 31 December next year. Will see how small I was hoping to archive compared to what I will have. LOL

## Blazor and component models of it

![clipboard.png](Publish/2024/assets/fbWpRd9l8-clipboard.png)
Read a few pages of Blazor's book, getting deeper into the `LifeCycles` of components in Blazor. It is very similar to how it works in other JS frontend frameworks. Only need more time to understand how `async` methods work on that picture. I hope to have a better understanding next week.

## Change in the company at the architect's level.
I watched the recommended presentation on how system engineering and the method of Jogh Kotter have been done to change how IT teams in the company use lifecycles for architecture and designing new systems. 
I was introduced to John Kotter and his books ("Leading Change" 2013 and "Change" 2023) and his training program on how to make it happen. 

I have ordered both books and will try to see if that knowledge will be helpful for me to pay for it compared to my plans to do some MIT programs in the summer.

## Ideas/insights to introduce to life/routine

### Before starting working on tasks with Pomodoro
Try to use the first Pomodoro on reviewing and thinking about a topic I am about to start. Check my previous notes and search the internet on this topic.

### One day - one note
I started to use single notes for the whole day, even if I was taking notes on "Area" and "Project" I already have in my base. It will force me to rereview all my notes/thoughts/knowledge I am processing and force me to spend more time rereviewing them.

### Took relevant notes and put them into the right place
My thoughts are on whether to put all my notes over a day in one place. When will I take and move to the project place? One idea is to do it simultaneously when I do a note summary on the weekend. That version has a slight chance of happening because the note summary already takes time. So I will only need a little time to dedicate to more work. What is it at the end of the day? Nah, also no chanses. 
Only make dedicated time slots for information from notes I know is relevant for some projects I am working on to return to notes and mine valuable data for the project. In that case, where will "Areas" be? Hmm, areas only have future material (mined) for potential projects. Or remove them? I also have "Projects," "ZET," and "Knowledge Base" (with concepts and practices).
