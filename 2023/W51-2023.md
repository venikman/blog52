The energy of the moon. Perception.

# Sitnikov

Finished watching the course of Aleksey Sitnikov. Have a few things to share with everybody:

_Trance_ - is one of the normal states that our brain has, and it is normal. So what is it? Have you
ever been watching (focused) on one item/place/dot while in your brain, you had other pictures
flashing, and it was more realistic for you? It was a trance state. But it is not only about vision.
It can be any of our sensors being replaced by our brains. Only if you will replace every sensor
with something that in your brain could be called _Hypnosis_.

I have also been introduced to the "another" pyramid that helps you to see the order of importance
to your identity. It has 6 levels of maturity that you can grow in your life, from lowest to
highest:

6. Surrounding. What do you have around you? People, things, what you own.
7. Behaviour. What are you doing now in your life?
8. Skills. How do you select? Which prism you are using?
9. Believes and values. What do you believe in?
10. Identity. Who are you?
11. Mission. Why? Why you are who you are? Why are you doing what you are doing?

You can think about it not as a pyramid but as a hill. You start from the bottom (level 6) and try
to think about this question. Write your thoughts down. Then go up(level 5). Until you get to level
one. When you have the answer to "What is your mission?" from the top of the hill, you go back down.
So, look again at the question at level 2. It should help you to see it differently. Until level 6.
That exercise helped me to review my personality from a new angle. You should try to do it as well!

## FOPO (Fear of Other People's Opinions)

We all fear that other people are always watching us. This is not true. And that effect was called:
_The Spotlight Effect_.

> RULE: Never assume that people are thinking about you. Until they talk about you.

## Screens

Concept _screens_ could be used as filters or opinions that you care about and want to make sure
that opinion will be good about your behavior. And here are _screens_ which opinion you care about:

### Purpose

The purpose is bigger than another opinion.

### Your roundtable

1. Who wants what's best for you.
2. Who you deeply respect.
3. Who are not afraid to tell you the truth.

> As check for yourself: What would my roundtable think?

### Your death

> Given that I am going to die soon... is it worth letting people's opinions into my life?

# Article: Technical debt in the engineering of complex systems.

[Link](https://incose.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sys.21677)

TD(technical debt) is a very important topic for the SE area. This article talks about hidden TD
when we use COTS(commercial off-the-shelf) and how to do an evaluation of TD and deal with it. There
is one more term that is being introduced: _taxonomy_; this is the debt itself.

The taxonomy identifies seven TD types:

- functionality
- performance
- interoperability
- version conflicts
- documentation and support
- system evolution and organic, based on systematic indicators and signs discoverable during early
  acquisition activities.

## What is TD?

Coming from 1992, introduced by Ward Cunningham.

> Shipping first-time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it
> is paid back promptly with a rewrite. . . The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid.

**Kruchten et al.â€™s TD landscape**: ![clipboard.png](Publish/2024/assets/zUwEsrr0v-clipboard.png)

**Rubin's taxonomy for agile development**:

1. Naive TD. Just not enough knowledge.
2. Inaviodable TD.
3. Strategic TD.

## Adopting TD to the Engineering of complex systems

![clipboard.png](Publish/2024/assets/L2WoN5OXW-clipboard.png)

### Missing characteristics of the engineering of a complex system

- **Inclusion of visible factors**. How will COTS, even if it is an internal tool, affect external
  users?
- **A new "Accountability" axis**.
- **Factors at individual COTS level**.
- **Factors at system level**.

## A COTS TD TAXONOMY FOR THE ENGINEERING OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS

TABLE. The taxonomy of TD in the engineering of complex systems.

| TD category           | Description                                                                                                                            | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functionality         | The degree of functionality mismatch between COTS and system needs.                                                                    | Hidden cost and risk due to the need to modify and extend COTS to meet specific CPS needs to mask unwanted COTS features for security concerns.                                                                                                         |
| Performance           | The degree of mismatches between COTS and system needs, w\.r.t. performance properties.                                                | Hidden cost and risk due to the increased need for system modeling and simulation analysis, testing to verify the reliability, security, performance, etc.                                                                                              |
| Interoperability      | The degree of system modularity, COTS interface complexity, and interoperability among COTS and custom components.                     | Incurred cost and risk for later integration activities due to integration challenges. The more complex the COTS interfaces, or the higher degree of inter-dependencies between components, the more difficult and more expensive it is to rework them. |
| Version Conflict      | Configuration management planning needs to address COTS refreshing strategy, version conflicts, as well as solution availability plan. | The more COTS elements, the higher the frequency of COTS new releasing, and the greater the risk of this TD.                                                                                                                                            |
| Documentation support | The availability of COTS documentation and vendor support.                                                                             | Lack of documentation and vendor support will seriously impact on issue resolution related to obsolete COTS.                                                                                                                                            |
| System evolution      | The impact of COTS usage on long-term system evolvability to leverage innovative technologies.                                         | Requirements and design decisions imposed by COTS may place great limitations on system evolution.                                                                                                                                                      |

### Functionality TD

Anti-patterns that you may get:

1. The reliance on COTS technology to increase the likelihood of achieving technical goals;
2. The reliance on commercial technology to adapt quicker to changing operational requirements;
3. The capability expectation gap in immature COTS technologies.

### Performance TD

Anti-patterns:

1. The reliance on subsystem testing to predict overall technical program success;
2. Using simulations to substitute for or reduce full-scale testing;
3. Optimism for COTS scalability.

### Interoperability TD

Usually, you can have 3 mismatched assumptions: interface mismatch, internal assumption mismatch,
and dependency mismatch.

Anti-pattern:

1. Relying on implied benefits of open architecture to facilitate independent development and rapid
   updates.
2. Lack of geometric risk function on top of program sub-component.

### Version conflict TD

Anti-pattern:

1. The assumption of COTS refresh efforts done in a smooth, coordinated way.

### Documentation and support TD

Anti-pattern:

1. The assumption of cooperative vendors to jointly customize and stabilize COTS products for
   extended government use.

### System evolution TD

Anti-pattern:

1. Assumption that new capabilities can be easily added to meet future needs.

### Organic TD

Anti-pattern:

1. The reliance on commercial initiative/standards to insulate program risk
2. Government acting as system integrator.

# Lex convo with Bezos

This week's interview is with Lex Fridman and Jeff Bezos. This was the first time I watched Jeff
giving an interview (for some reason, I never watched him before). They talked about his childhood
and his vision for space exploration. It is interesting to highlight that he and Elon do not know
each other even though they are both hitting outer space.

He also shared how we are dealing with some business moments:

- There are two types of decisions: one-way door and two-way door. Two-way doors are easy to go in;
  you always can come back. And for a one-way door (as a decision), you really have to be confident
  because the price to go back is much bigger.
- It was about trust; you can say that you disagree with the idea but are still going to commit. And
  it is about trust in the team.

# Lean coffee

(Docs)[http://leancoffee.org]. I think my team should try to do it next year as an activity for our
team culture building, and we can also practice some _lead_ development techniques.

# Inbox freeze.

I have so much information to consume, and it is growing faster than I can consume it. And I need a
plan to try to execute it.

# Insights

## A Book tutorial is better than a video tutorial

Instead of video tutorials that you follow, buy/get a book on the same topic. Usually, it will have
the same structure, building a single project as you go, but it will focus on concepts that will be
translated into practical use in the project.

## Why we all need a mentor

The mentor is helping to identify _Blind spots_ and to move something from _unknown not-competency_
to _known competency_. And share personal experiences.

## Leasure

When you have intellectual work, do physical leisure, so the brain can recover, and the opposite if
you have physical work.
