My first weekly summary of notes that I am taking. Inspired by [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method of taking notes. Here, I will be doing an overview of interesting thoughts or something I have learned this week.

## Hidden Potential
I have watched a short [overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESCEEXewIMU) of the book by Adam Grant [Hidden Potential](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Potential-Science-Achieving-Greater/dp/B0C5Y6DM2D/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=661102537594&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9051515&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11262291050242916883&hvtargid=kwd-2087537167098&hydadcr=15527_13558519&keywords=adam+grant+hidden+potential&qid=1700429621&sr=8-1), 10 mins done by week free subscription I have [Productiviti Game](https://lozeron-academy-llc.ck.page/49088799fa). I have been subscribed to this week's emails for more than 2 years. It can introduce me to the book I did not have an opinion or did not know. Sometimes, I overview on a topic I am not interested in, but sometimes (like this time), it made me really consider putting this book almost to the top of my priority of books I want to cover next (I have not really "a list," but it is really in my mind that I want to listen or read, probably listen via Audible).

On book from review:
- A few points I have intuitively been doing myself, like turning work into a game; the mindset of making mistakes is a requirement for growth, so you are comfortable with it.
The main thing in enabling personal Potential is to have and cultivate "character skills".

## .NET conf 2023

A week after huge announcements from partners and partially or fully owned companies by Microsoft (OpenAI and Github) on AI progress. Microsoft also had technical progress on programming platform and language they maintain `C#` and `.NET` (or `dotnet`). It was 3 days with loaded content of updates. I did not have a chance to watch all of them or watch something I am interested in, in `live,` but I was trying to catch up. I am not going to manage everything, but I will list what I have seen:
- Blazor updates. There are a few main moments to cover that coming with a main scheduled update for the platform (`.NET` version 8.) before the Blazor project allows you to choose, will it be a `server` project (serving static HTML and with updates like `islands`  concept, and some interactivity would be done by `websockets` connection. Or you could choose for the project to be `web assembly`, which would build a single binary delivered to the frontend once, and the server part would be done for the Blazor part. The new updates allow you to combine those 2 strategies in one project and make that selection component![clipboard.png](Publish/2024/assets/mnDX3DHOB-clipboard.png)
- Telemetry library from `.NET`. It was nice to learn that there is a monitoring standard [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/overview.md). And `dotnet` supports it so you can plug the shape of the data and how metrics being captured other systems that are not from Azure. Also, for Logging, use `LoggerMessage` instead of the raw logging strategy with `ILogger`.
- On `C#` on Everyday:
  - Records is just an improvement for comparison (check equality) and gives better output on `toString.`
  - Struct is also a way to go if you want a data type. And together, `struct record` gives you the ability for pure data comparison.

Also, on other learnings for Blazor (I also owe already to my coworker to start reading a book on Blazor, and we have to cover 2 first chapters): for adding classes to components (in docs, they reffer to `Children` if you have scoped `CSS` file we will have to add specific selector [`::deep`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-8.0#child-component-support) which is not part of `CSS`.

## Other programming bites.
For PostgreSQL and MongoDB, their default ways of working are based on `single servers` initialization coming new replacement, and it is called the same for both: flexible server for Azure ([PSQL on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/css-isolation?view=aspnetcore-8.0#child-component-support), and [flexible Sync for Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/realm/realm-flexible-sync/).


## Interview with CEO AmoCRM [Mikhail Tokovinin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhailtokovinin/), 

> [Link to the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LURMUksRu60)

It was a handy overview of how some people in the tech industry think about management and creating new trends. Also, the story of one of Russia's oldest and most successful tech products/companies. 

Here are a few insights for me:
- In Russia, management has two forms: managing products and managing people. And you still have separate Leadership from a motivation standpoint.
- How to identify trends: If 'geeks' get bored with a new 'thing'/'tool' but the regular users have never heard about it, this is potential for recent trends. Because it is easier to create a new pattern of behavior that will be a platform for new trends than trying to change current people's ways of behavior.

Friday after lunch was also hot for the AI world after Sam Altman was fired (unexpectedly for most of us). The weekend was an excellent topic for people who do not like holidays like Thanksgiving. I have to check some YouTube opinion videos (more for fun, from Primagen). But what was happening most of you will probably know: some other folks from the company were fired too, and some just followed Sam. Will see what will be next week since there are already conversations about returning him. Here is a nice joke from Elon(X's account, but we know who did this) on [X](https://twitter.com/X/status/1725635308224426030).

## Learning
Paid for 2 different online events:
- [Retreat in the form of summary for the year](https://www.kristenhadeed.com/retreat)
- [FP for DDD with F# by Scott](https://www.avanscoperta.it/en/training/domain-modeling-made-functional-workshop/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=scott_wlaschin) . SUPER EXITED!!!

## SSM (School of System Manegements)

Listened to a 3-month-old innovation lab session for exploring administrating and organizing internal platforms for companies (aka how to think about internal DevOps products) from the SM model. My central insight was that it can be considered the same as accounting. Some teams make decisions and implement strategies (like financial architects), which is the same thing we can think about DevOps. They are to monitor and keep track of operations.
